 🌐 Site accessed and served through Nym mixnet

This website is hosted on a server and both accessed by visitors and served to them through the **Nym mixnet**, a decentralized network that anonymizes connections for enhanced privacy.

---

### How it works

Your traffic is routed through Nym's **five-hop mix network**:  

1. Entry gateway  
2. Three mix nodes  
3. Exit gateway  

Using **Sphinx packet encryption**, packet shuffling, and cover traffic, Nym hides your **IP address**, **location**, and **browsing patterns**, protecting both **data and metadata** from surveillance.  

Unlike Tor, which uses three hops and supports hidden services, or VPNs, which are centralized and may expose metadata, **Nym provides stronger privacy** for standard internet access.
